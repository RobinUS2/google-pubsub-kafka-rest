# google-pubsub-kafka-rest
Implements the basic features in Confluent kafka rest but produces to Google PubSub

Why would I use this?
-------------
It is developed as an easy way to migrate for Kafka with the [Confluent Kafka REST API](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-rest) to [Google PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/overview).
